				<p>Hi, My name is Michael Lopez, I'm currently in High School. The school that I attend as this moment is Bartlett High School. My favorite thing to do is to play video games, mostly computer ones. My life has been all about computer since I was a little kid. I'm in progress of learning how to code with an awesome teacher. I hope I get better so I can use it in the future.</p>
